## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Gridbox
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

-  Non-technical skills:

   -    The best way for me to approach a project is to break down each task into smaller tasks 
   -    Notating/Planning what my process will be before starting the tasks helps as well. This allows me to follow a    guildline/checklist 
   -    Concepts I didn't understand or needed additional information on were saved & reviewed at the end of the day or following day. This allowed me to continue on with my workflow. 

-  Technical skills:
   -  Responsive UI/UX development
      -  Using the chrome inspector to emulate different screen sizes 
      -  Using chrome inspector to help me build out the site so I can see it in real time
   -  Grid & Flexbox as well as Javascript to create responsive and dynamic layouts

### Continued development

-  My goal is to continue to fine-tune my skillset to decrease my time on projects. To acheive this goal, I intend on creating projects to work on my time & effeciency.
